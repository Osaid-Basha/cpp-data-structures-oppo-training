## ✅ Completed Structures

| Data Structure       | Status  | Notes                            |
|----------------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| Dynamic Array        | ✅ Done | Supports resize, push, pop, set |
| Linked List          | ✅ Done | Singly linked list               |
| Stack (Array-based)  | ✅ Done | Built using dynamic array        |
| Stack (Linked List)  | ✅ Done | Built using singly linked list   |
